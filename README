This package provides support for units of physical quantities. Its main
components are:
    1) A C library, "libudunits2", for:
        a) Obtaining a binary representation of a unit;
        b) Manipulating units arithmetically; and
        c) Obtaining a converter of numeric values between compatible units;
    2) A utility, "udunits2", for
        a) Obtaining the definition of a unit; and
        b) Converting a numeric value between compatible units; and
    3) An extensive database of units.

To install this on Linux, you'll need to configure and make it, e.g. with:
