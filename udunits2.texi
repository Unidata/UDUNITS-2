@chapter Introduction
@cindex Introduction

The UDUNITS-2 package provides support for units of physical quantities.
Its three main components are:
@enumerate
@item
A C library
for units of physical quantities
@ref{, , , udunits2lib};
@item
A utility
for obtaining the definition of a unit and for
converting numeric values between compatible units
@ref{, , , udunits2prog}; and
@item
An @ref{Database, , extensive database of units}.
@end enumerate

@node Differences, Installation, Introduction, Top
@chapter How This Package Differs from the Original @code{UDUNITS} Package

The @code{UDUNIT-2} package differs from the @code{UDUNITS-1}
package in the following ways:
@itemize @bullet

@item @strong{Support for non-ASCII characters:}  
The @code{UDUNITS-1}
package only supports the ASCII character set.  The @code{UDUNITS-2}
package supports the following character sets: ASCII, ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1),
and the UTF-8 encoding of ISO 10646 (Unicode).  This means that unit
string specifications like "@code{µ°F·Ω⁻¹}" are now supported (your
viewer must support UTF-8 to display this string correctly).

@item @strong{Support for logarithmic units:}  The unit string
specification "@code{0.1 lg(re 1 mW)}" specifies a deciBel unit with a
one milliwatt reference level.
Such units are fully integrated into the package and all meaningful
operations and conversions are supported.

@item @strong{Persistent value converters:}
It is now possible to obtain a @emph{converter} data-object, which can
be used to convert numeric values in one unit to numeric values in another,
compatible unit.  The values can be @code{float}, @code{double}, or
one-dimensional arrays of @code{float}s or @code{double}s.

@item @strong{Improved API:}  Due to the above changes, it was not
possible to keep the application programming interface (API) of the
@code{UDUNITS-1} package.  The new interface, however, is easily
understood and easy to use.  To support backward comptibility,
the package does contain a version 1 C API, which uses the version 2
library.

@item @strong{XML unit database:}  The unit database is encoded using
human-readable XML rather than a custom format.  The XML
parser included in the package supports an @emph{<import>} element to
allow easy and convenient customization.

@item @strong{No Fortran or Perl API:}  Interfaces for these languages
have not yet been created.  Contact
@email{support-udunits@@unidata.ucar.edu} if you are interested in
helping to create these interfaces.

@end itemize

One thing that has not changed is that almost all unit string specifications
understood by the @code{UDUNITS-1} package are also
understood by the @code{UDUNITS-2} package.  One exception is
the symbol @code{g}, which in version 1 of the package was associated with
standard free fall (a unit of acceleration) but which is associated
with the unit gram in version 2 of the package.

@section Prerequisites for This Package
@cindex prerequisites for this package

The Expat library and header-files must be installed. Look for the library 
"libexpat" and the header-file "expat.h".

If this package is to be tested (which is optional), then the CUnit library
and header-files must be installed. Look for the library "libcunit" and the
header-files "CUnit/CUnit.h" and "CUnit/Basic.h".

If this package is to be built on a Windows system, then the CMake and MinGW
packages must be installed. Look for the utility "cmake" and the
directory/folder "MinGW".

@node Binary, Source, Prerequisites, Installation
@section Installing from a Binary Distribution
@cindex installation, binary

Currently, only an RPM binary distribution is supported.

Download the distribution by browsing to the Unidata UDUNITS RPM repository at
@uref{https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/service/rest/repository/browse/rpm-udunits/udunits/}
or by executing, for example, the following commands:
@example
cd ~/Downloads
wget https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/repository/rpm-udunits/udunits/udunits-@value{VERSION}-x86_64.rpm
@end example

Install the distribution. For example,
@example
sudo rpm --install [--prefix=/opt/udunits] ~/Downloads/udunits-@value{VERSION}-x86_64.rpm
@end example
where the argument in square brackets is optional. The default installation
directory is @code{/usr/local}.

@subsection Installing from source on Unix
@cindex installing from source on Unix

Download the source by browsing to the Unidata UDUNITS source repository at
@uref{https://downloads.unidata.ucar.edu/udunits/}
or by executing, for example, the following commands:
@example
cd ~/Downloads
curl -O https://downloads.unidata.ucar.edu/udunits/@value{VERSION}/udunits-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
@end example

Unpack the distribution in an appropriate place. For example,
@example
cd /opt
sudo pax -rz < ~/Downloads/udunits-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
@end example

Build and install the package. For example
@example
cd udunits2-@value{VERSION}
./configure [--prefix=@var{install_prefix}] >&configure.log
make all [check] install [install-html] [install-pdf]
@end example
where the arguments in square brackets are optional. The default installation 
prefix is the parent directory of the source directory.

@node Windows, , Unix, Source
@subsection Installing from source on Windows
@cindex installing from source on Windows

Download the source by browsing to the Unidata UDUNITS source repository at
@uref{https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/service/rest/repository/browse/downloads-udunits/}
or by executing, for example, the following commands:
@example
cd C:\Users\@var{current_user}\Downloads
curl -O https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/repository/downloads-udunits/udunits-@value{VERSION}.zip
@end example

Unpack the distribution by opening the downloaded file and extracting the
contents to, for example, the user's "Downloads" folder. Note that, by default,
the extractor might create an extra top-level folder with a duplicate name.
Remove the extra folder from the destination path if this is the case -- either
before or after extraction.

Build and install the package using cmake(1). For example
@example
cd C:\Users\@var{current_user}\Downloads\udunits2-@value{VERSION}
mkdir build
cd build
cmake [-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=@var{install_prefix}] ..
make all install
@end example
where the argument in square brackets is optional. The default installation 
folder is the parent folder of the source folder.
