@cindex Introduction

The UDUNITS-2 package provides support for units of physical quantities.
Its three main components are: 1) @ref{Top, , a C library, udunits2lib}
for units of physical quantities;
2) @ref{Top, , a utility, udunits2prog};
for obtaining the definition of a unit and for
converting numeric values between compatible units;
and 3) an @ref{Database, , extensive database of units}.

@node Differences, Installation, Introduction, Top
@chapter How This Package Differs from the Original @code{UDUNITS} Package

The @code{UDUNIT-2} package differs from the original @code{UDUNITS}
package in the following ways:
@itemize @bullet

@item @strong{Support for non-ASCII characters:}  
The original @code{UDUNITS}
package only supports the ASCII character set.  The @code{UDUNITS-2}
package supports the following character sets: ASCII, ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1),
and the UTF-8 encoding of ISO 10646 (Unicode).  This means that unit
string specifications like "@code{µ°F·Ω⁻¹}" are now supported (your
viewer must support UTF-8 to display this string correctly).

@item @strong{Support for logarithmic units:}  The unit string
specification "@code{0.1 lg(re 1 mW)}" specifies a deciBel unit with a
one milliwatt reference level.
Such units are fully integrated into the package and all meaningful
operations and conversions are supported.

@item @strong{Persistent value converters:}
It is now possible to obtain a @emph{converter} data-object, which can
be used to convert numeric values in one unit to numeric values in another,
compatible unit.  The values can be @code{float}, @code{double}, or
one-dimensional arrays of @code{float}s or @code{double}s.

@item @strong{Improved API:}  Due to the above changes, it was not
possible to keep the application programming interface (API) of the original
@code{UDUNITS} package.  The new interface, however, is easily
understood and easy to use.  To support backward comptibility,
the package does contain a version 1 C API, which uses the version 2
library.

@item @strong{XML unit database:}  The unit database is encoded using
human-readable XML rather than a custom format.  The XML
parser included in the package supports an @emph{<import>} element to
allow easy and convenient customization.

@item @strong{No Fortran or Perl API:}  Interfaces for these languages
have not yet been created.  Contact
@email{support-udunits@@unidata.ucar.edu} if you are interested in
helping to create these interfaces.

@end itemize

One thing that has not changed is that almost all unit string specifications
understood by the original @code{UDUNITS} package are also
understood by the new @code{UDUNITS-2} package.  The one exception is
the symbol @code{g}, which in the original package was associated with
standard free fall (a unit of accelleration) but which is associated
with gram in the new package.

@node Prerequisites, Obtain, , Installation
@section Prerequisites for this package
@cindex prerequisites for this package

The Expat library and header-files must be installed. Look for the library 
"libexpat" and the header-file "expat.h".

If this package is to be tested (which is optional), then the CUnit library
and header-files must be installed. Look for the library "libcunit" and the
header-files "CUnit/CUnit.h" and "CUnit/Basic.h".

If this package is to be built on a Windows system, then the CMake and MinGW
packages must be installed. Look for the utility "cmake" and the
directory/folder "MinGW".

@node Obtain, Unix, Prerequisites, Installation
@section Obtaining this Package
@cindex obtaining this package

Get this package from its download-page at
@uref{http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/udunits/}
and unpack it in an appropriate place, e.g.,

@example
cd /usr/local/src
gunzip -c udunits-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz | pax -r
@end example

@node Unix, Windows, Obtain, Installation

@node Autoconf, CMake, , Unix
@subsection Autoconf-based installation

@subsubsection Short instructions

@example
./configure [--prefix=@var{root}] [--disable-shared] [CC=@var{path}]
make
make check                      # optional; requires CUNIT installation
make install                    # also installs INFO documentation
make install-html install-pdf   # optional
make clean
@end example

By default, the installation root is @code{/usr/local}.

@subsubsection Long instructions

@enumerate
@item
Go to the top-level source-directory of this package, e.g.,
@example
cd udunits-@value{VERSION}
@end example

@item
If necessary, clean-up from a previous installation attempt by making
the @code{distclean} target using the @var{make} utility from step 2:
@example
@var{make} distclean
@end example

The option @code{--disable-shared} causes the build process to create
a static library only: a sharable library is not created.
This option is necessary if the @code{libtool} utility that's included
in this package can't build a sharable library using the given compiler.

@item
Execute the @code{configure} script.
Specify the installation prefix, the compiler from the
previous step, and any required option.
For example, if you are on an HP-UX system and want to use
the @code{/bin/c89} compiler and install under @code{/opt},
then the following command is appropriate:

@example
./configure --prefix=/opt --disable-shared CC=/bin/c89
@end example

If the installation prefix is not specified, then the default
is to install under @code{/usr/local}.

If the compiler isn't specified, then the default is to use
@code{gcc}.

@item
Build this package by making the default target using the @var{make} utility
from step 2:
@example
@var{make}
@end example

@item
If you wish to verify that this package works correctly,
then make the @code{check} target using the
@var{make} utility from step 2:
@example
@var{make} check
@end example
This step is only effective if the @code{configure} script found an
installed @code{CUNIT} unit-testing package.  If that package wasn't
found, then the above command will quickly exit without testing this
package.

@item
Install the @ref{Top, , library, udunits2lib}, 
@ref{Top, , utility, udunits2prog}, header-files, units-database, and
INFO documentation files by making 
the @code{install} target using the @var{make} utility from
step 2:
@example
@var{make} install
@end example

@item
If desired, install the HTML and PDF documentation files by making 
one or more of the following targets 
using the @var{make} utility from step 2:
@example
@var{make} install-html install-pdf
@end example

@item
Clean up by making the @code{clean} target using the @var{make} utility
from step 2:
@example
@var{make} clean
@end example
@end enumerate

@node CMake, , Autoconf, Unix
@subsection CMake-based installation

@example
cmake
make all [test] install [install_test]
@end example

where the arguments in square brackets are optional.

@node Windows, , Unix, Installation
@section Windows Installation Instructions

Currently, only a 32-bit @uref{http://www.mingw.org,MinGW}-based installation is
supported:

@example
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles"
cmake --build . [-DUDUNITS_INSTALL_PREFIX=@emph{dir}] -- all [test] install [install_test]
@end example

where arguments in square brackets are optional.

The default installation-prefix is 
"@code{C:\Program Files (x86)\udunits-2.}@var{minor}.@var{bug}", where 
@var{minor} and @var{bug} are the minor version and bug-fix level,
respectively.
